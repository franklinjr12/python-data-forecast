# Python data forecast

I created this repo to store my test codes for a projects class in university which ocurred in late 2021. The goal was to develop a system for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction of heavy machines and the tools used were Python and Power Bi. I was the one responsable for developing the python scripts for the system. Some statistics and machine learning were tested in this project for learning porpuses.

The results are in the [presentations folder](/presentations) and the final script used is the [main.py](/final_tests/main.py) in final_tests folder.
